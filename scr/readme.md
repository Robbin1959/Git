The What We Eat in America (WWEIA) Food Categories provide an application to analyze foods 
and beverages as consumed in the American diet. Each of the food and beverage items that 
can be reported in WWEIA, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey are placed in
one of the mutually exclusive food categories. This is done by linking each food code 
contained in the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to one WWEIA 
category. The focus of this categorization system is on grouping similar foods and 
beverages together based on usage and nutrient content.
